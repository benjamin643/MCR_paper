This repository contains the analysis for the submission of "Spatial context of ovarian cancer tumor-infiltrating immune cells associates with improved survival" to the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). 

In the background folder, you will find a data dictionary. 

In the data folder, you will find a sub-sample of the data that was used to conduct the analysis and reach the conclusions presented in the paper. In the cox_data set, there are the main variables that were used for analysis, including cell type percentages for each sample and the distance variable calculation for the B cell and Macrophage relationship. There are other data sets as well that include the distance relationships for other cell types and are identified in the name of the data set. 

In the analysis folder, you will find code that was used for analysis. Specifically, the code to clean, organize and trim down data, run Kaplan-Meier analysis, and conduct Cox-Proportional models is laid out. The code is commented with explanations provided for actions that may seem unclear or require explanation. Additionally, there is a separate document that was used to create graphs for the visual overview. 

In the results folder, you will see the knitted documents of the analysis code previously mentioned as well as some figure outputs that were used in the paper. 

Lastly, in the paper_submission folder, you will find the cover letter, manuscript, and visual overview that was submitted to AACR. You will also see supplmental material and reviewer response from the first submission.
